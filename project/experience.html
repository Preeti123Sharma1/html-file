    <h1><b><u>Experience:-</u></b></h1>
    <pre>
        Teachers help students in developing their minds and values. 
        A student learns many things from his/her teacher like basic manners, discipline, new concepts, etc. 
        Teaching experience is often counted, asked, or taken into concern when 
        teachers try to find new jobs or we can say while the recruitment process.
